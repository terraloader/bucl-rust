# connect_test — supports both named and positional calling conventions.
#
# Named:      {r} connect_test {host} {port}    → uses {host} and {port}
# Positional: {r} connect_test "myhost" "9090"   → uses {0} and {1}
# Struct:     {r} connect_test {db}               → unpacks {db/host}, {db/port}
#
# The function checks for named params first, falls back to positional.
