# ── Named Parameters Test Suite ──────────────────────────────────────────────

# Test 1: Named params from root variables
{port} = "5593"
{host} = "127.0.0.1"
{r} connect_test {host} {port}
echo "test1: {r}"

# Test 2: Order independence — same result regardless of arg order
{r2} connect_test {port} {host}
echo "test2: {r2}"

# Test 3: Named params from sub-variables ({db/port} → name "port")
{db/port} = "3308"
{db/host} = "myserver"
{r3} connect_test {db/host} {db/port}
echo "test3: {r3}"

# Test 4: Struct expansion — {srv} unpacks its named sub-vars
{srv/port} = "8080"
{srv/host} = "localhost"
{r4} connect_test {srv}
echo "test4: {r4}"

# Test 5: Purely positional (backward compat) — same function, no named params
{r5} connect_test "myhost" "9090"
echo "test5: {r5}"
